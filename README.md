# Autodock Vina-GAG

## Overview

Autodock Vina-GAG is an enhanced version of Autodock Vina-Carb, specifically designed for the docking of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). This tool significantly improves the performance and accuracy of molecular docking simulations involving GAGs by introducing charged interactions, which are critical for accurately modeling the behavior of these complex biomolecules.
